DOM Manipulation, Web Storage, and JSON Handling Project
Project Overview
This project, DOM Manipulation, Web Storage, and JSON Data, focuses on building a dynamic web application that generates, manages, and filters content based on user interactions. 
I explore advanced JavaScript concepts, including DOM manipulation, web storage, and working with JSON data to create an interactive and persistent web experience.
